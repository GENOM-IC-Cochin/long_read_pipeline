# Long Read Pipeline
A long read pipeline in construction by paulimer. Intended for use by Gallois' team on their HIV cellular alternative splicing project.

For now, input sample names/paths, name by name at the beginning of the Snakefile. The reference/annotation location are customizable, in the config file. The conda environment necessary to run the pipeline is in the `env_ont_hiv.yml` config file.
